# Python For Networking

### Introduction
These are a series of projects I've worked on which demonstrate some of the capabilities of python for network. These scripts are intended to sharpen my own skills in Python, and make me more well rounded as a networking professional. I hope you find this code interesting if not useful. 

Cheers. 

#### What You'll Need

This project was done on a Microsoft 10 machine using Visual Studio Code and running programs from the terminal. Installation of Python and Python documentation can be found [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

These projects were largely taken from the "Python Network Programming Cookbook", which you can find [here](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Network-Programming-Cookbook-real-world/dp/1786463997/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=python+network+programming+cookbook&qid=1647821274&sprefix=python+network+pro%2Caps%2C83&sr=8-1). The book I have has the programs written for python 2.7, so I have adapted the programs for python 3.
